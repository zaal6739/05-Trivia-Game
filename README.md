# 05-Trivia-Game

This game focuses on geography trivia.  You will be quizzed on worldwide national parks, historical monuments, and general geography.  There are a total of ten questions, and you will have 30 seconds to answer each of the questions.  After each question is answered, a screen will appear to show whether or not you answered the question correctly and a GIF associated with each of the questions.  The technologies used for this project were  javascript, jquery, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

The GIF's are on timers, which may explain why the screen doesn't move when the user clicks, or if the GIF's are not animated if the connection is too slow.  The biggest challenge with this project was in approaching how to best code the transitions between elements and incorporate these elements into arrays.  The problem was solved by holding each question, possible answers, and the correct answer in a single array and looping through the prompts as the user progresses through the application.
